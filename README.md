#Dogs vs Cats Image Classification
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is written in python language. This CNN model is trained on few thousand images of cats and dogs, and later be able to predict if the given image is of a cat or a dog. 

#Simple Image Classification using CNN — Deep Learning in python.
The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps.
Step 1: Convolution
Step 2: Pooling
Step 3: Flattening
Step 4: Full connection
