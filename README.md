# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is written in python language. This CNN model is trained on few thousand images of cats and dogs, and later be able to predict if the given image is of a cat or a dog. This model achieves over *80%* accuracy.

## Simple Image Classification using CNN — Deep Learning in python.
The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps. <br />
Step 1: Convolution <br />
Step 2: Pooling <br />
Step 3: Flattening <br />
Step 4: Full connection <br />
